## Macro Environment

| Indicator | Value | Direction | Implication |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| DXY | 97.42 | ↑ +0.27% 5d, above SMA20 (97.17) | USD strengthening — headwind for risk |
| 10Y Yield | 4.086% | ↑ +0.74% 5d | Rising yields — headwind for growth/tech |
| 2Y Yield | 3.448% | → flat | Stable short end |
| 2s10s Spread | +0.638 | Normal curve | No recession signal |
| FOMC | Mar 17 | 22 days out | Not imminent, no position constraint |
| F&G Crypto | 5 | Extreme Fear | Contrarian bullish signal (66.1% accuracy) |
| F&G Stocks | 55 | Neutral | No edge |

**Macro verdict**: Rising DXY + rising yields = mild headwind for tech/growth. Crypto in extreme fear territory (contrarian BUY signal historically 66% accurate). FOMC far enough out to trade freely.

## Signal Accuracy Context (1d horizon, used for weighting)

**Most reliable (>60%)**: Funding 96.4%, F&G 66.1%, ML 65.8%, Calendar 64.4%, momentum_factors 61.4%, RSI 60.1%, BB 60.8%

**Least reliable (<45%)**: Momentum 33.4%, EMA 42.1%, Trend 40.8%, Oscillators 41.9%, Fibonacci 42.9%, Heikin_ashi 44.1%, Ministral 44.4%

**Consensus accuracy**: 55.7% — barely above coin flip. Independent judgment matters more than vote counting.

## Category 1: Long-Term Holds (Accumulate on Dips)

### MU — Micron Technology ★★★★
**Price**: $426.70 | **RSI**: 53.6 | **ATR**: 0.19% (very low vol) | **BB**: inside
**Signal**: HOLD (1B/0S — only volume_flow BUY)
**Timeframes**: ·BB BB·S (12h through 1mo BUY, 6mo SELL)

| Level | Price | Note |
|-------|-------|------|
| Support 1 | $420 | Entry zone, avg cost area |
| Support 2 | $410 | 2x ATR stop ($426 - 2×$1.61) |
| Resistance 1 | $435 | Prior swing high |
| Resistance 2 | $440 | Extension target |

**Thesis**: Semiconductor demand cycle intact. Both portfolios long. 4/7 mid-term TFs BUY. Low volatility (ATR 0.19%) means steady grind, not a breakout play. Entry was at $423.42 — holding above cost basis. Patient strategy should hold and wait for stronger signal before adding (only 1 active voter currently).

**Action**: HOLD both portfolios. Add on dip to $420 if BUY voters increase to 3+.

---

### AAPL — Apple ★★★
**Price**: $264.38 | **RSI**: 53.0 | **ATR**: 0.52% | **BB**: inside
**Signal**: HOLD (2B/0S — volume 3.32x + volume_flow)
**Timeframes**: ······BB (only 3mo+6mo BUY)

| Level | Price | Note |
|-------|-------|------|
| Support | $261 | 2x ATR below current |
| Resistance | $270 | Recent range high |

**Thesis**: Volume spike (3.32x) with upward bias but no short-term signal yet. Long-term TFs BUY. Classic accumulator — not urgent, but worth watching for a dip-buy entry if signals activate.

**Action**: Watch. Not actionable until 3+ voters align on short-term.

---

### LMT — Lockheed Martin ★★★
**Price**: $658.16 | **RSI**: 49.0 | **ATR**: 0.27% | **BB**: inside
**Signal**: HOLD (2B/0S — sentiment + volume_flow)
**Timeframes**: ···BB·S (7d+1mo BUY)

| Level | Price | Note |
|-------|-------|------|
| Support | $654 | 2x ATR below |
| Resistance | $665 | Prior high area |

**Thesis**: Defense sector stability. Medium-term BUY alignment (7d+1mo). Sentiment positive (0.60 conf). Uncorrelated with tech — good portfolio diversifier. Low ATR = low risk.

**Action**: Watch for entry. Patient could BUY at $654 support if 3+ voters activate.

---

## Category 2: Short-Term Plays (Days — Swing Trades)

### TSM — Taiwan Semiconductor ★★★★★ TOP PICK
**Price**: $370.77 | **RSI**: 61.0 | **ATR**: 0.13% (ultra-low vol) | **BB**: inside
**Signal**: BUY 100% conf (3B/0S — sentiment, volume_flow, candlestick)
**Timeframes**: BBBBB SS (Now through 1mo BUY, 3mo+6mo SELL)

| Level | Price | Note |
|-------|-------|------|
| Entry | $370-372 | At open or minor pullback |
| Support 1 | $368 | ~2x ATR below |
| Support 2 | $365 | Hard stop |
| Target 1 | $378 | 2% move |
| Target 2 | $385 | Swing target |

**Thesis**: Strongest signal alignment on the entire board. 5 consecutive short-term TFs BUY (Now/12h/2d/7d/1mo). Candlestick pattern confirming. Sentiment 0.75 (strong positive). Ultra-low ATR means controlled risk. The 3mo+6mo SELL says this is a swing trade, NOT a buy-and-hold — take profits at $378-385.

**Why it's the top pick**: 100% consensus confidence, 3 active voters (all BUY, zero SELL), 5/7 TFs aligned. Was already on watchlist from last session ("TSM Monday open — confirm 7/7 TF + vol >1.5x for Patient BUY"). Short TFs confirmed, just need volume at open.

**Warrant play**: MINI-TSMC (underlying TSM, 5x leverage preferred). If TSM moves +2%, warrant moves ~+10%. Entry at open, stop at TSM $365 (-1.5%), target TSM $378 (+2%).

**Action**: Patient BUY if volume >1.5x at open confirms. Bold BUY on breakout above $372.

---

### META — Meta Platforms ★★★★
**Price**: $655.66 | **RSI**: 53.2 | **ATR**: 1.01% | **BB**: inside
**Signal**: BUY 64% conf (3B/1S — sentiment, volume_flow, momentum_factors BUY; mean_reversion SELL)
**Timeframes**: BBB SS·B (Now/12h/2d BUY, 7d/1mo SELL, 6mo BUY)

| Level | Price | Note |
|-------|-------|------|
| Entry | $653-658 | At open |
| Support | $642 | 2x ATR below |
| Stop | $635 | Hard stop |
| Target 1 | $668 | +2% |
| Target 2 | $680 | Swing target |

**Thesis**: Short-term BUY alignment (Now/12h/2d) with momentum_factors (61.4% accuracy) confirming. Mean_reversion SELL is the counter-signal but that indicator is only 53.6% accurate. Low volume (0.68x) is the main risk — needs confirmation at open. 7d+1mo SELL means take profits within 3 days.

**Action**: BUY if Monday volume >1x average. Short-term swing only (exit by Wed-Thu).

---

### XAG-USD — Silver ★★★
**Price**: $86.36 | **RSI**: 64.7 | **ATR**: 0.53% | **BB**: inside
**Signal**: BUY 74% conf (3B/1S — volume 2.21x, trend, volume_flow BUY; fibonacci SELL)
**Timeframes**: BS·S (Now BUY, 12h+7d SELL)

| Level | Price | Note |
|-------|-------|------|
| Entry | $85.50-86.50 | Current level |
| Support | $85.40 | 2x ATR below |
| Stop | $84.50 | Prior support |
| Target | $88.00 | +2% move |

**Thesis**: Volume 2.21x spike with trend + volume_flow BUY. Fibonacci SELL is the counter (retracement concern). RSI 64.7 getting warm but not overbought. Mixed TFs (Now BUY vs 12h+7d SELL) suggest quick trade. DXY rising is a headwind for metals.

**Warrant play**: MINI-SILVER (5x leverage). Quick scalp potential but DXY headwind limits upside.

**Action**: Quick scalp only. Not a swing hold given DXY trend and contradictory TFs.

---

### SMCI — Super Micro Computer ★★★
**Price**: $32.27 | **RSI**: 51.4 | **ATR**: 0.30% | **BB**: inside
**Signal**: SELL weighted consensus BUT 3B/1S raw votes (sentiment, volume_flow, heikin_ashi BUY; candlestick SELL)
**Timeframes**: S BBBB SS (Now SELL, 12h/2d/7d/1mo BUY, 3mo/6mo SELL)

| Level | Price | Note |
|-------|-------|------|
| Entry | $32.00-32.50 | Pullback to open |
| Support | $31.70 | 2x ATR below |
| Stop | $31.00 | Hard stop |
| Target 1 | $33.50 | +4% |
| Target 2 | $35.00 | Swing target |

**Thesis**: Contradictory signals — weighted consensus says SELL (high-accuracy candlestick signal) but raw votes are 3B/1S. The key tell: 4 mid-term TFs are BUY (12h through 1mo). If the candlestick SELL is noise, this is a mid-term swing up. If it's real, Monday opens with selling. Wait for the first 30 minutes to resolve the conflict.

**Action**: Wait for Monday open. If holds $32+, BUY for swing. If breaks below $31.70, skip.

---

## Category 3: Day-Trade Bets (Monday Open Only)

### GRRR — Gorilla Technology ★★★ (DAY TRADE ONLY)
**Price**: $11.40 | **RSI**: 54.0 | **ATR**: 0.52% | **BB**: inside
**Signal**: BUY 100% conf (5B/0S — MACD, sentiment, volume_flow, fibonacci, heikin_ashi)
**Timeframes**: B··SSSS (Now BUY, everything 7d+ SELL)

| Level | Price | Note |
|-------|-------|------|
| Entry | $11.30-11.50 | At open |
| Stop | $11.15 | 2x ATR below |
| Target | $11.85 | +4% |

**Thesis**: Highest raw voter count on the board (5B/0S). MACD crossover + fibonacci + heikin_ashi all aligned. BUT every timeframe beyond Now is SELL. This is textbook day-trade material — the short-term momentum is real but it's against the medium/long-term trend. Don't hold overnight.

**Risk**: $11.40 stock = illiquid. Spread and slippage risk on exit. Small cap volatility.

**Action**: Day-trade only. Buy at open, hard stop $11.15, target $11.85. Close by 3pm ET regardless.

---

### UPST — Upstart Holdings ★★★ (DAY TRADE ONLY)
**Price**: $29.42 | **RSI**: 46.6 | **ATR**: 0.57% | **BB**: inside
**Signal**: BUY 100% conf (3B/0S — sentiment, volume 2.06x, volume_flow)
**Timeframes**: BSS···S (Now BUY, 12h+2d SELL, 6mo SELL)

| Level | Price | Note |
|-------|-------|------|
| Entry | $29.20-29.50 | At open |
| Stop | $29.00 | Just below round number |
| Target | $30.50 | +3.5% |

**Thesis**: Volume 2.06x spike signals institutional activity. But 12h+2d TFs are SELL — this is a one-check wonder. If there's a gap-up on Monday (possible with the volume spike), take it fast. If flat open, skip.

**Risk**: Trap setup. Volume spike + opposite medium-term signals = classic fakeout pattern.

**Action**: Only if gap-up at open. Scalp and exit within 2 hours. Skip if flat.

---

### PLTR — Palantir ★★ (CAUTIOUS)
**Price**: $134.52 | **RSI**: 45.4 | **ATR**: 0.78% | **BB**: below_lower
**Signal**: BUY 100% conf (3B/0S — bb, volume_flow, mean_reversion)
**Timeframes**: B····SB (Now BUY, 3mo SELL, 6mo BUY)

| Level | Price | Note |
|-------|-------|------|
| Entry | $133-135 | At BB lower touch |
| Stop | $131 | 2x ATR below |
| Target | $138 | Mean reversion to BB midline |

**Thesis**: Below lower BB = mean-reversion setup. BB signal has 60.8% accuracy. Mean_reversion signal also BUY. But volume is only 0.76x (LOW) — no confirmation of buying pressure. This is a low-conviction bounce play.

**Risk**: Low volume invalidates the bounce thesis. PLTR is volatile (ATR 0.78%). Could easily break lower.

**Action**: Day-trade only if Monday volume >1.5x. Skip otherwise.

## Avoid / Watch List

### NVDA — NVIDIA (HELD BY BOLD) ⚠️
**Price**: $190.00 | **RSI**: 59.8 | **Signal**: SELL 63% (3B/2S)
**Timeframes**: S····BB (Now SELL, 3mo+6mo BUY)

**Concern**: Now TF SELL + RSI approaching overbought + mean_reversion SELL. Bold holds 56.56 shares at $189.97 (break-even). Sentiment is BUY and volume 1.92x is bullish. The conflict: short-term overbought but long-term trend intact.

**Action**: HOLD existing position. Do NOT add. Set mental stop at $185 (2x ATR below). If Monday opens below $188, consider reducing position to 50%.

---

### VRT — Vertiv (WATCHLIST FLIPPED) ⚠️
**Price**: $243.70 | **RSI**: 54.1 | **Signal**: SELL 78% (2B/1S)
**Timeframes**: S····SS (Now SELL, 3mo+6mo SELL)

**Previous thesis**: Was 7/7 TFs BUY, 6B/2S. Was top Monday candidate.
**Current reality**: Flipped to SELL. RSI is the only SELL voter but weighted confidence is 78% (RSI has 60.1% accuracy). TFs degraded from 7/7 BUY to mostly SELL.

**Action**: REMOVED from watchlist. Do NOT buy. Thesis invalidated.

---

### AVGO — Broadcom ⚠️
**Price**: $332.96 | **RSI**: 51.0 | **Signal**: SELL 92% (1B/2S)
**Timeframes**: S·····B (Now SELL, 6mo BUY)
**Note**: Above upper BB = overbought. Mean_reversion SELL. Avoid longs.

---

### VERI — Veritone ⚠️
**Price**: $2.86 | **Signal**: SELL 91% (1B/3S)
**Timeframes**: SSS·SSB (5/7 SELL)
**Note**: Volume 4.41x with SELL direction = heavy distribution. Strong avoid.

---

### ETH-USD ⚠️
**Price**: $1,942 | **Signal**: SELL 63% (2B/3S)
**Timeframes**: S··S·SS (4/7 SELL)
**Note**: F&G=5 (Extreme Fear) provides contrarian support but structure is bearish. MACD -0.18, ministral SELL. Not tradeable from long side until TF alignment improves.

---

### BTC-USD — Neutral/Conflicted
**Price**: $67,214 | **Signal**: BUY 57% (4B/6S)
**Timeframes**: B··S··B (Now BUY, 7d SELL, 6mo BUY)
**Note**: Below lower BB + F&G=5 + RSI 36.9 = deep contrarian setup. But 6 SELL votes vs 4 BUY means the crowd is split. Mean_reversion BUY + bb BUY (60.8% accuracy) vs volume_flow SELL + structure SELL + volatility SELL. Not clean enough to trade. Watch for 7+ BUY votes to emerge.

## Monday Morning Playbook

**Pre-market (13:00-14:30 UTC / 14:00-15:30 CET)**:
1. Check pre-market futures for gap direction on QQQ/NASDAQ
2. Check if TSM pre-market confirms Friday's signal strength
3. Check BTC price — if below $65K, crypto fear will bleed into tech stocks

**At open (14:30 UTC)**:
1. **TSM**: If volume >1.5x average in first 15 min → BUY for Patient + Bold
2. **GRRR**: If gaps up → quick scalp, target +4%, stop -2%
3. **NVDA**: Watch $188 support. If broken → reduce Bold position 50%
4. **MU**: Hold. No action unless drops below $420

**First hour (14:30-15:30 UTC)**:
1. **META**: If volume >1x and holds above $653 → swing BUY
2. **SMCI**: If holds $32 and volume confirms → swing BUY
3. **UPST**: Only if gap-up. Scalp within 2 hours.

**Close monitoring (20:00-21:00 UTC)**:
1. Close ALL day-trades (GRRR, UPST, PLTR if entered)
2. Review TSM/META positions — if negative, tighten stops to breakeven

---

## Risk Notes

1. **Rising DXY + yields** = headwind for all risk assets. This is not a "buy everything" environment.
2. **Signal accuracy is mediocre** (consensus 55.7%). Trust price action over signal counts.
3. **Weekend data is stale** for stocks. Monday gap direction overrides all analysis above.
4. **VRT thesis flip** is the biggest warning sign — signals that look perfect can reverse overnight.
5. **Bold portfolio risk**: NVDA at break-even with SELL signal. MU stable but thin signal support (1 voter). Both could turn quickly.
6. **Size appropriately**: Use 15% (Patient) / 30% (Bold) allocation rules. No conviction overrides on day-trades.
