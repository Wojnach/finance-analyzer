# BTC Non-Trade Investigation — 2026-02-13

## Question
BTC jumped today but Bold didn't trade it. Was this a missed opportunity?

## Finding: Correct behavior — Bold was right to HOLD

Bold was invoked 9 times during the BTC move. Each time it correctly chose HOLD because:

1. **RSI ~80.7 (overbought)** — Buying into overbought territory contradicts Bold's breakout
   philosophy. Breakouts enter at the *start* of a trend, not after RSI hits extremes.

2. **MACD decelerating** — MACD histogram was positive but shrinking, indicating momentum
   was fading, not expanding. Bold requires expanding momentum for breakout confirmation.

3. **Longer timeframes all SELL** — 2d, 7d, 1mo, 3mo, 6mo timeframes were all showing SELL
   signals. A structural breakout requires at least some timeframe alignment. All longer TFs
   being bearish suggests this was a counter-trend bounce, not a new trend.

4. **No volume expansion** — Volume did not confirm the move with a significant spike above
   the 20-period average, which Bold requires for breakout confirmation.

## Conclusion

Bold's personality (Breakout Trend Rider) correctly identified this as momentum noise rather
than a structural breakout. The move lacked the hallmarks Bold looks for: expanding volume,
timeframe alignment, and entry at trend initiation. Buying here would have been chasing,
not trend-riding.

This is exactly the scenario Bold's guidelines warn about: "Don't chase the first signal;
enter when a new trend *begins*."
